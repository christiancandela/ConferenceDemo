= Conference Demo

This small sample project showcase the development of 3 micro-services using both Jakarta EE 10 and Eclipse MicroProfile 5.0

The domain model and real-world requirements are inspired in the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-conference[official conference demo project] for the Eclipse MicroProfile stack.

== Services

The following services are defined:

. *Speaker*: Handles all speakers data and provides a default configurable list of venues.
. *Session*: Handles session data. Unlike the official Conference demo, here scheduling sessions is doing in tandem while creating them, so no `schedule` service is used.
. *Vote*: Handles session rating and the creation of attendees.

== Provisioning

All three services are provisioned using https://www.payara.fish/payara_micro[Payara Micro 6]. The Payara Micro Maven Plugin is configured on all three projects.
